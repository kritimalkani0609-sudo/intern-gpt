# Intern GPT — Internship Scam Detector
# Verify internship, stay safe
# Project overview
Intern GPT is a web-based platform built to help students identify fake or suspicious internship offers.
Students can paste internship messages received through platforms like WhatsApp, Email, LinkedIn, or Telegram, and the system analyzes the content to determine whether the offer looks safe or risky.
The project is developed as a working prototype for Hack The Winter – Round 1, focusing on awareness, prevention, and simple verification.
## Problem Statement
With the increasing use of online platforms for hiring interns, internship scams have become very common. Students often receive offers that:
Promise very high salaries or incentives Select candidates instantly without interviews Ask for registration, training, or security fees
Due to excitement or lack of awareness, many students trust such messages and end up losing money, time, or personal information. 
### Proposed Solution
Intern GPT provides a simple way for students to check internship messages before responding. The platform analyzes the message using predefined scam indicators and logical checks to: Identify suspicious patterns
Assign a risk level (Low, Medium, or High)
Display safety tips so students can take the right action
The goal is to support students in making safer decisions, not to replace human judgment.
